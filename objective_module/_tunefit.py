# _tunefit.py — joint PEQ optimizer + minimum-phase classifier + audibility score.
# Companion to _devcalc.py (which stays the measurement/deviation workhorse).
# Added 2026-07-02 (Fable max pass). Everything here is self-tested by `python _tunefit.py`.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (the gap vs TuneEQ / REW's own EQ window):
#  - TuneEQ and REW fit bands GREEDILY, one at a time, to raw magnitude error.
#    Greedy = each band ignores how its skirts change the next band's problem.
#    fit_peq() fits all bands JOINTLY (scipy least_squares over the full cascade).
#  - Neither weights the error by audibility. audibility_score() ERB-smooths the
#    residual and weights by where the ear is sensitive, so the optimizer spends
#    its band budget where it is HEARD, not where the plot looks worst.
#  - Neither checks EQ-ability physics. REW's own doctrine (minimumphase.html):
#    "Anywhere the excess group delay plot is flat is a minimum phase region"
#    -> correctable. Sharp dips with wild excess-GD swings are non-minimum-phase
#    -> EQ cannot fix them. excess_gd_mask() computes that classifier from a
#    single-position export WITH PHASE (REW text export, 3 columns).

        NARROW filter above the transition (hf_q_penalty x (Q-knee) when
